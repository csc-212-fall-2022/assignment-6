# Assignment 6

## 22.1-3: Transpose a Graph

The _transpose_ of a directed graph G=(V,E) is the graph G^T = (V, E^T) where E^T = {(v,u) | (u,v) in E } (i.e. the graph
with all the edges of G) reversed.

Implement `AdjacencyListDiGraph::Transpose` (in `AdjacencyListDiGraph.cpp`) and `AdjacencyMatrixDiGraph::Transpose`
(in `AdjacencyMatrixDiGraph.cpp`).

## 22.4-3: Cycle detection

Give an _undirected_ graph G, determine whether it contains a cycle.

Implement `Graph::ContainsCycle` in `Graph.cpp`
